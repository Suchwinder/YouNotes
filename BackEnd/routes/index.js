/**
 * Imports for all our routes in order to use them in our app.js
 * Before Express v4, and in general you coul use app.get or app.use etc.
 * but as applications have grown, each of these routes can get complex.
 * As a result, instead of having app which is our express instance for the main app
 * we can create mini apps that basically are routers and these routers can
 * do the same thing as app.use etc.. but its designed for modularizing routes
